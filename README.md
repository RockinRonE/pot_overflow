# Pot Overflow

##### Introduction
In [Dev Bootcamp] we were assigned a group project in which we were to create a Stack Overflow like site for any subject. We created a site in which users could post cooking related questions called Pot Overflow (anyone who has cooked has had a pot overflow). The app was built using Sinatra and Bootstrap. 

##### User Stories:

As a user, I want to:

- login/logout.
- when logged in, be able to post a question.
- when logged in, be able to post a response.
- as the original poster, select the best answer to my question.
- view all questions and answers, without logging in.
- view my profile page with stats.
- vote a question or answer up or down (only once).
